# Data Annotation and Bounding Box Normalization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on data annotation and bounding box normalization for images. The script processes annotations for objects within an image, normalizes the bounding box coordinates, converts them to a different format, and saves the results as CSV and JSON files. Additionally, it includes a visualization of the bounding boxes drawn on the image using Matplotlib.

### Key Features:
- **Bounding Box Normalization**: Normalizes bounding box coordinates relative to the image dimensions.
- **Converted Bounding Boxes**: Converts bounding box coordinates to a format with width and height for easier processing.
- **CSV and JSON Output**: Saves the normalized and converted bounding boxes in CSV and JSON formats.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes on the image using `matplotlib`.

## Usage

### Steps to run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-annotation.git
   cd data-annotation
   ```

2. Add your image (in this case, an image named `image.jpg`) in the root folder.

3. To run the script, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python annotation.py
   ```

4. After running, the following files will be generated:
   - **normalized_bounding_boxes.csv**: Contains the normalized bounding box data.
   - **converted_image_annotation.json**: Contains the converted bounding box format.
   - **image_annotation.json**: Contains the original annotation data.

5. The script will also display the bounding boxes visually on the image.

## File Descriptions

- **annotation.py**: The main script which processes image annotations, normalizes and converts bounding box coordinates, saves the results, and visualizes them.
- **image.jpg**: The image file used for annotation and visualization. You can replace this with your own image file.
- **image_annotation.json**: A JSON file generated by the script containing the original annotation data for the objects in the image.
- **normalized_bounding_boxes.csv**: CSV file with normalized bounding box coordinates.
- **converted_image_annotation.json**: JSON file with converted bounding box format, including width and height of the boxes.

3. **Bounding Box Visualization**: The script will open a window with the image displayed, and the bounding boxes (e.g., "Player", "Ball") drawn on top of the image.
